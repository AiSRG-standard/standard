Introducing AiSRG: An Open Standard for AI-Web Communication
Today, we are launching a new project that will forever change how artificial intelligence interacts with the digital world. Welcome to AiSRG (Ai Service Reference Guide).

The Problem: AI is Smart, Yet "Blind"

In an era where AI assistants can write poetry, solve complex equations, and create art, they face a fundamental limitation: they cannot truly "act" on the internet.

Today's AI is like a brilliant librarian who has read every book in the world. But when you ask them, "Can you reserve that book for me?" they can't. They can only tell you how to reserve it yourself.

The connection between AI and digital services is currently a "Walled Garden" system, requiring special, custom integrations for each service. This stifles innovation and excludes smaller providers.

The Solution: A "Universal Manual" for AI

AiSRG is an open, central standard that functions as an "AI Service Reference Guide."

Simply put, AiSRG is a simple set of rules that allows any website or service to create an aisrg.json file—a "manual" that tells an AI:

"Hello! I am the Coffe Zoo website."

"Here are the services I can perform for you: view the menu, book a table, order a delivery."

"To book a table, here is the information you need and the back door (API Endpoint) you need to send it to."

Through a simple discovery mechanism using a Meta Tag, any AI that supports this standard can automatically discover and learn the capabilities of millions of websites.

Our Vision: "The Open Kitchen"

We are not building a product; we are building an "Open Kitchen" where everyone can participate:

Service Providers can use our "recipe" to make their services accessible to a new wave of customers.

AI Developers can build smarter and more useful "kitchen appliances."

End-Users will get a truly seamless experience.

We have chosen the Apache License 2.0 to ensure this standard remains open and secure for everyone, forever, backed by a defensive patent strategy to protect our community.

We Invite You to Build the Future

AiSRG is a community-driven project, and this is just the beginning. We believe the real power will come from everyone who participates.
